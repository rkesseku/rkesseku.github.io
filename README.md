# Project 1: Predicting precipication for Austin weather data.
Due to the high collinearity between some predictors, we employ algorithms creates new variables removing 
the collinearity between them or those that suffer less from such effect. \
Accordingly, four (4) of such models chosen were;\
\begin{enumerate}
\item Partial Least Squares
\item Elastic net
\item Random forest
\item Xgboost
\end{enumerate}
